# Hipreme Engine WebAssembly project

## THIS BUILD REQUIRES HIPREME ENGINE CUSTOM D RUNTIME

### Quick Start
To get it, call `git submodule update --recursive`. This will clone the custom D runtime.

### Notices

1. The D custom runtime was started by Adam D. Ruppe, in arsd-webassembly. HipremeEngine has implemented all of the other
necessary features for it being able to run the entire engine. That means, including implementing a little bit of C standard library,
phobos and the runtime itself.
2. Some errors that didn't happen on Windows/Linux may happen when using this version. Please do put an issue to be fixed.
3. This runtime may become version locked as the D runtime hooks keeps changing.
4. In the future, this may be replaced by the real D runtime, so, try to not lose too much time trying to optimize D runtime related bugs (GC).


### What code you can't use:

1. `catch`: You can throw errors, they will be converted to `assert(false, "message")`. They won't be able to be caught though.
2. Fibers: The way they are implemented is by stack winding/unwinding which requires some assembly, so they were completed dropped out.
3. Threads: Threading was not implemented for the custom runtime. This may be at least simulated in future.
4. `static this`
5. `~static this`: Those 2 aren't actually hard to support, but I decided to not implement them as I don't use it on the engine. Keep in mind that the game engine provides a way to simulate them. It automatically creates `scriptmodules.txt` for you to be able to iterate all your `source` folder directory.

### Garbage Collection

This custom runtime allocates memory which will never be freed. For small games, that is okay. HipremeEngine only allocates memory that requires GC on startup. The entire update loop is partially `@nogc`(doesn't allocate but I'm not locking anyone by not using this attribute). That means it won't allocate nor leak memory during gameplay, that means you can create a complete game using the D runtime without getting OutOfMemory. This have been tested a lot and the engine is pretty concerned in how, where and when the memory allocation will happen. It was decided to make the engine do not contribute to a collection occur.


## Generating a build for WASM

Enter HipremeEngine's root and call `wasmtest.bat` (this batch can be easily converted to shell).
After that, in the very same folder this readme is located, call `dub`. It is the development server for the WASM port. You can access your game at `localhost:9000`
