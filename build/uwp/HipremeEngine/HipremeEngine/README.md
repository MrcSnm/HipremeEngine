# HipremeEngine UWP Project

This project has the filters auto generated directly when dub is run for
UWP project.

For being victorious in debugging your UWP application, always check
the "Output" window. A lot of effort was done for making UWP debugging
easier.

In no time, that folder will be bloated with auto generated files from
Visual Studio. So, to make it a lot easier for development, UWPResources
folder was created for reflecting the "assets" folder from the parent
path.
